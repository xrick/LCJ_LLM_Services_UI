Now when you open this page:

Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
Go to the Console tab
You should see initial logs like:
"DOM loaded, initializing..."
"Message input found"
"Send button found"
"Initializing chat..."
"Thread created successfully: [thread-id]"
When you try to send a message, you should see logs like:

"Send button clicked" or "Enter key pressed"
"Attempting to send message: [your message]"
"Creating EventSource with threadId: [thread-id]"
"EventSource URL: [url]"
Please try this updated version and let me know what logs you see in the console. This will help us identify exactly where the process might be failing.
