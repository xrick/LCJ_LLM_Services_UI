I am working on a ocr-llm web application, the current status is a as following:
1. I have implemented several files:
    1.1. index.html:
           - The main interface of the web application.
           - it contains two parts: left-side-bar and right main page-holder
           - there are three items on the left-side-bar:[home], [models], [chat-history]
           - the content of [home] will be shown on the right page-holder.
           - the content of [home] is a block-based selection menu, currently has five blocks.
           - each block stands for a llm-agent.
           - currently there are <AI聊天>, <寫作建議>, <規範管理>, <eBook>, and <作文OCR服務>
    1.2. main.py:
           - The main app entry point and rounter logic.
    1.3. ocr_page.html:
           - ocr service main page.
    1.4. ocr_page.js
           - javascript for ocr_page.html
